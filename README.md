# FIFA 20 Player Clustering using Unsupervised Learning

This project applies unsupervised machine learning techniques to group FIFA 20 players into distinct clusters based on their performance and attributes. It aims to help with scouting, player comparison, and team-building strategies by revealing hidden patterns in player data.

## Problem Statement
With thousands of football players and numerous attributes, itâ€™s challenging to evaluate or compare them objectively. Clustering players into roles or performance groups using data science techniques allows better decision-making in sports analytics.

## Dataset
The dataset contains player information from the FIFA 20 video game, including attributes such as:
- Overall rating
- Potential
- Passing, Shooting, Dribbling
- Defending, Physical
- Position, Value, and more
  
## Tools & Libraries
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Pandas, NumPy for data handling
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization
- Scikit-learn for clustering algorithms

## Techniques Used
- K-Means Clustering
- Hierarchical Clustering (Agglomerative)
- Elbow Method
- Silhouette Score

## Project Workflow
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Feature selection and scaling
3. Applied Elbow Method to find optimal clusters
4. Implemented K-Means and Agglomerative clustering
5. Visualized player clusters using PCA and scatter plots

## Key Outcomes
- Grouped players into distinct clusters based on playstyle and ability
- Identified optimal number of clusters using Elbow & Silhouette methods
- Provided data-driven insights for team-building and scouting

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository
2. Open `fifa20_clustering.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
3. Run the cells step by step
